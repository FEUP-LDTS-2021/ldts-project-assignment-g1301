In this old school game you play the role of a spaceship trying to survive an attack of flying monsters. You ultimate goal is to KILL THEM ALL!!!  

In this fixed shooter the spaceship moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### PLANNED FEATURES

The game will contain all its original basic features and potential a few more developed by us, such as:
The game may contain different monsters with each one containing unique features.
We may also add more weapons to the spaceship so the game becomes more fun as you're playing it.
And we are also planning to add power ups to the spaceship like the ability to gain extra velocity.
